    "This is a project to visualize the popularity of songs based on where they occur within an album. There are a variety of articles about how someone putting together an album may want to structure their sequence, but this is an attempt to see if there are any overarching trends visible across many of music's best and most popular albums.\n",

    "My main hypothesis is that artists will typically put their top stuff in the first half and in particular put what they believe to be their most popular song in the third or fourth spot.\n",
